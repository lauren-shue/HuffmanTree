# HuffmanTree
This program creates a uses the Huffman tree algorhitm to compresses the text into binary. First, it goes through and creates a frequency list which is then added to a binary tree in nodes in descending order. It then goes through the binary tree and prints out its search structure to get the data for each letter, printing a 1 if it goes to the right of the binary tree and a 0 if it goes to the left.
